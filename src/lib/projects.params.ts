			'In my university studies, I undertook a machine learning project focused on object detection. The project aimed to develop a system capable of identifying individuals in images, with a specific emphasis on whether they were wearing masks or not. I explored various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including VGG, MobileNetV2, and Xception. This approach allowed me to evaluate the impact of different network structures on both accuracy and performance. Ultimately, the Xception model achieved the highest degree of accuracy in detecting individuals with and without masks. However, the MobileNetV2 model offered a more efficient solution with faster processing speeds and a lower number of parameters compared to VGG and Xception.',

			'This ray tracing program simulates the rendering of a scene containing a single sphere illuminated by a point light source. Instead of Sphere class we can use any i used it because it is simple to draw and process .Utilizing ray-sphere intersection calculations, it traces rays from each pixel in a 2D grid to determine if they intersect with the sphere. Upon intersection, the program computes the shading of the pixel based on the surface normal and the direction to the light source. Outputting the results in the PPM image format, the program dynamically selects the output file destination, either defaulting to "out.ppm" in the current directory or placing it in an "images/" directory if present. Through this process, the program showcases the foundational concepts of ray tracing in computer graphics, offering a glimpse into the generation of realistic images through ray-object interactions and light interactions.
